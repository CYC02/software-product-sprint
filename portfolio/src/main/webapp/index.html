      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm currently a rising junior at Hunter College in New York City. I love drawing, digital art, and gaming! 
          My family immigrated to the US from China, and I was born and raised in NYC. 
          My family speaks Taishanese and Cantonese, but I'm not fluent with either dialect. 
          I'm currently learning Chinese (Mandarin) in college; so I can improve my understanding of the language. 
          When I was younger, I would watch anime on the weekends like YuGiOh and Dragon Ball Z , and I think my interest in drawing and eventually digital art started from watching those shows. 
          I also played Pokemon games and Sonic games on the Gameboy which led to my interest in game development. 
          One day, I would like to create a game where people can connect over it and have fun.</p>

      <h3>Winter 2021 Hunter Codefest Submission</h3>

      <a href="https://cyc02.github.io/winter-2021-codefest-submissions-certified-couch-potatoes/">Hunter Codefest Project</a>
      <p>In the winter of 2020-2021, there was a college event called the Hunter 2021 Codefest. 
          The students would form their groups on Slack, and I teamed up with five other students. 
          We created a website with a game called "A Lockdown Story." 
          We finished this project in about six weeks and presented it to Google engineers. 
          At this time, I was the only freshman in my group. 
          So I was very inexperienced, and I focused on producing the art in the game. 
          There were many things we wanted to add to the game, but we couldn't due to time constraints. 
          Regardless, I like how this project came out, so if you'd like, take a look!</p>

      <h3>Gender in Gaming | WGS 100 Final Project</h3>
      <img src="/images/blinking.gif" width="120px" height="100px"/>
      <a href="https://cyc02.github.io/WGS-Final-Project/">Final Project for WGS 100</a>
      <p>The main focus of this project is the animation, but I decided to put it on a website because I would have a place to write additional ideas about my topic. 
          I created this as a final project for my WGS 100 class. 
          I spent about 2-3 weeks on this project, and I focused on the animation in the first two weeks. 
          I used the knowledge I gained from the Hunter Codefest to create a simple website hosted on Github. 
          If I had more time, I would've added more to the website and made the animation smoother.</p>

      <p>I made this for an optional Game Design summer class in high school. 
          This small game was inspired from Pokemon gameplay. 
          It is suppose to be a silly and funny game where Sara tries to win Billy's heart.</p>
